# ReceiptSplitter

## General Idea:
Take a photo of a receipt and load the text into a web page allowing you to divide the cost of any particular item between any number of people. 

## Functionalities:
- Take photo and read the text into whatever file
- Add as many “users” as are required
- Toggle on or off each user for each item
- Allow manual entry if needed of how to split the cost for a specific item (in case of non even splitting of something)
- Be able to click an item name (see if I can call to a Walmart API or something) and display the item image
- Be able to finalize selections and produce a receipt for each user showing their purchase summary
- Possibly allow it to remember for next time what people got what item (hard bc i dont wanna have to have people to log on)
